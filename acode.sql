In the second folder on my machine I am changing the file with other text while not adding 
or committing and pushing, but I will do some pushing of this file. 
Just want to know how the file will be handled.
Just added text to other file and just saved it, I will push the changes of this file right now.

well this file is not an sql file anymore but some text file,....
I am just going to add more text and see how this this works out. 
Well just now I added some text to the other acode.sql file and pushed it. 
I have not yet git pulled. Just saved the file in the folder. 

so both text are added to this file,...
