In the second folder on my machine I am changing the file with other text while not adding 
or committing and pushing, but I will do some pushing of this file. 
Just want to know how the file will be handled.
Just added text to other file and just saved it, I will push the changes of this file right now.

well this file is not an sql file anymore but some text file,....
I am just going to add more text and see how this this works out. 
Well just now I added some text to the other acode.sql file and pushed it. 
I have not yet git pulled. Just saved the file in the folder. 

so both text are added to this file,... 

let's save and git pull what happens?

I have save the other file and I am going to push this one

<<< HEAD
here I am writing sentence 2 at the same time sentence 1 is written on the other file
sentence 1 has been pushed.
so now I am going to push this one,... 

====
here I am writing a sentence 1,.... 
I am going to git add, git commit, git push this sentence
>>>> 

so sentence 1 was pushed,... 
when I wanted to push sentence 2 there was a conflict. 
so git pull
the file is amended and shows where the conflict is,.. 
so now git add git commit git push,... 


And yes off course it works. 

I reverted the commit and the sentence 'revert this sentence' is gone from this file. 
now git add, git commit, git push




lets just correct this sentence; let's should be with a capital letter. 
Lets adjust above sentence. 
I do not want to correct that sentence, it is good as it is. 
Dude(tte), all sentences need to start with a capital letter;)
ok,., we'll do that,...
